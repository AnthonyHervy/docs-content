cPanel is a website management control panel tool, providing users with a graphical interface and fast access icons which allow the configuration and monitoring of their hosting solutions.

## How to access the Webmail 

If you wish to manage your e-mails through cPanel, you can access the webmail platform directly via the webmail link in the **Hosting information** of your Webhosting.

## How to configure the Nameserver

Nameservers are servers used to translate domain names into IP addresses. When you enter a URL in a browser, they show you where the website is located, instead of memorizing entire numerical sequences in the form of IP addresses.
