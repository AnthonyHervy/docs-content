## What is the difference between the Standard class in PAR and the Standard class in AMS and WAW?
Scaleway Object Storage uses erasure code  (6+3) to secure your data, today the data is distributed across three different racks inside the same DC. In case one rack becomes unavailable, we are still able to rebuild your data. 
On FR-PAR, your data is distributed across different Availability Zones (AZ). In case of DC failure we would still be able to rebuild your data and it would be accessible. This is the system we call multi AZ (one DC, in one AZ). 
With Standard class in PAR, your data is stored across three different AZ. Standard class in AMS and WAW currently allows you to store data across one AZ. We aim to make the multi-AZ Standard available in all regions in 2022/2023.

## What is the new storage class One Zone - Infrequent Access (IA)?
With One Zone - IA, your data is across three different racks inside the same DC. This storage class is a good choice for storing secondary backup copies or easily recreatable data. 
It can also be integrated into your lifecycle management rules, along with Standard and Glacier classes.

## Will these new storage classes affect how I use my buckets?
No! Any objects you upload into your buckets are added as Standard class objects by default, just as before. If you want to transfer your objects to One Zone - IA or Glacier you can do so manually or set up [lifecycle rules](/storage/object/api-cli/lifecycle-rules-api/). 

## I have a bucket and objects in PAR, but I do not want to use the new Standard class, is it possible to continue using the old one?
No, but it is possible to use the One Zone - IA class, instead. 

## Can I create a lifecycle rule to restore objects from Glacier class to One Zone - IA?
No. Restoring an object can only be done from Glacier to Standard class. Transition lifecycle rules can only be configured in the "top-down" direction. 

This means that you can transfer objects from Standard class to One Zone - IA and Glacier, but not from the last two to Standard. You can transfer objects from One Zone - IA to Glacier, but not restore objects from Glacier to One Zone - IA. The same applies when you make server-side copies.

## Do the new storage classes impact C14 Cold Storage (Glacier)?
No, the rules for using Glacier class remain the same and your data is still hosted in a databunker (DC4).

## Can I migrate my existing data to the new multi-AZ Standard class?
Yes, you will first need to create a new bucket and then copy your existing data into it. Follow [this procedure](/storage/object/api-cli/migrating-storage-class) to do so. 

## Do you plan to increase the pricing for the multi-AZ Standard class?
As your data will now be split across three different AZs, more investment is required on our side to provide the best service.
Standard in multi AZ will cost 0.013â‚¬/GB/month.

This new pricing will be applied starting from March the 1st. In the meantime, you can decide which storage class works best for your use case, multi-AZ Standard or One Zone - IA.
