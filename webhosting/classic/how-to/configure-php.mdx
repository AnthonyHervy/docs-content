## How to configure PHP at Scaleway 

phpinfo is a function of the PHP language, that allows you to see the active modules, the configuration of the server, the restrictions and the compilation parameters of the language: 

```
<?php
 
   // Display information about the PHP version used:
   echo phpinfo();
 
?>
```


For more information about the phpinfo of our PHP versions refer to the following links:

<Message type="note">

- The default version of PHP for all webhostings is PHP 5. During the creation of your webhosting, a `phpinfo.php` file will be created.

## How to use sessions? 

Sessions are a method to save certain information when you are browsing,(your shopping cart during a pending order, for example). The session system is a default feature of PHP.


<Message type="tip">

- Refer to the [official documentation](https://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.session.php) for more information about sessions. 

</Message>

Let us see how to use sessions with PHP4: 

1. Log into your PHP session using FTP and go to the folder `www/`in which you will add the code of your website. 
2. Create a new file and name it `start.php` containing the following lines:

        ```
        <?php
        session_start();
        session_register ("count");
        $count = 42;
        echo "We registered ".$count." <br>";
        ?>
        To go to the next page <A HREF="nextpage.php">click here</A>

        ```
3. Create a new file and name it `nextpage.php` containing the following lines:

        ```
        <?php
        session_start();
        session_register("count");
        echo "The previously registered count is " . $count ."<br>";
        ?>
        ```
4. Upload the files to your website and open the file `start.php` in your browser.



## How to configure a root directory? (DocumentRoot)


<Message type="important">

- Never use the absolute path `hard` coded in your site, because the path is likely to change and your site would be inaccessible.

</Message>


1. Use the variable `$DOCUMENT_ROOT` that points to the root of the website in which your script is being hosted.
2. Use `$path = “$DOCUMENT_ROOT/afolder/anotherfolder/”;` if you want to know the path of your website `http://www.mysite.ext/afolder/anotherfolder`



## How to configure a directory inclusion? (IncludePath)

As part of the creation of a large website, it is possible to centralize frequently included files by adding a default directory to the search list of included files. You must create it, as it is not created by default. 


1. Create a directory `include` (all lowercase letters) in the website's folder (for example: www/include).

    <Message type="note">

     - Such directory can only be used within the website it was created in. This means the main website's directory which is named `www/include` is not accessible from a secondary website such as `blog.domain.ext`).

    </Message>

2. Below is an example of a directory-inclusion: 

- Let us suppose you created a file `global.php` including different information or methods. 
- You want to access it from anywhere on your website without copying it in each subdirectory or enter the relative path to that file in each program.
- Let us assume that your `.php` files are located in the main website `www.mydomain.ext>`
- You have to create `www/include` and store your file `global.php` in it (it is therefore in `www/include/global.php` seen in FTP)
- Call it from a `.php` file regardless of where it is located inside the main website by writing: 

        ```
        <?php
         include("global.php"); 
         // suite du code...
        ?>

        ```
- You can also use: 

```
<?php
 require("global.php"); 
 // more code to follow...
?>

```

## How to connect to a database? 


<Message type="note">

- Persistent connections are not possible due to the architecture of the webhosting platform and are performed as a standard connection.

</Message>

Refer to the [documentation](#manage-mysql-database-phpmyadmin) to configure the connection to a database using PHP.


## How to upload files? 

<Message type="note">

- The maximum file size you can upload is 10 MB. 

</Message>


1. Rename an uploaded file using the function `move_updloaded_file` before the end of your script. 
2. The temporary file `phpXXXXX` will be deleted at the end of the receiving PHP script. 
3. Below is an example: 

```
<form method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data" action="upload.php">
<p>
<input type="file" name="file" size="30">
<input type="submit" name="upload" value="Upload">
</p>
</form>
 
<?php
if( isset($_POST['upload']) ) // if form is submitted
{
   $tmp_file = $_FILES['file']['tmp_name'];
   $name_file = $_FILES['file']['name'];
 
 
    if( !is_uploaded_file($tmp_file) )
    {
          exit("The file can not be found");
    }
 
    if( !move_uploaded_file($tmp_file, $name_file) )
    {
          exit("Impossible to move the file to $name_file");
    }
 
    echo "The file has been uploaded and can be found at  $name_file";
}
 
?>
```

## How to send emails? 


The email function of PHP is available, but it has some limitations:

- No more than 35 recipients per call of the function
- Maximum 500 outgoing mails per day, with a limitation of 60 mails/hour
- Size of the mails is limited to 2MB
- Antispam detection
- The mail function returns TRUE on success and FALSE if one of these conditions is not met.

Here is an example: 

- Let us suppose that the domain is `domain.ext`.

```
<?php
 
// Put here your valid email address
$to = "contact@domain.ext";
 
// Subject of the message 
$subject = "Test mail() function of PHP";
 
// Body of the message, text encoded using iso-8859-1
$message = "Hello,\nthe message was send. Regards the Webmaster\n";
 
// Headers of the message
$headers = ""; // we clear the variable
$headers = "From: Webmaster <webmaster@domain.ext>\n"; // Adding the From field
// $headers = $headers."MIME-Version: 1.0\n"; // Adding the MIME version
$headers = $headers."Content-type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1\n"; // Add the type of encoding
 
// Call the mail function
if ( mail($to, $subject, $message, $headers) == TRUE )
{
   echo "Mail sent.";
}
else
{
   echo "Error: The message could not be sent.";
}
 
?>
```

<Message type="important">

- Be aware that a malicious individual can use contact forms to send you spam. By calling several times a second, it will eventually saturate the `contact@domain.ext` email address you specified. The addition of a captcha can help you avoid this kind of hacking, and thus the suspension or cancellation of your account.
