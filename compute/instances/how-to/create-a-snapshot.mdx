The snapshot feature lets you create a backup of a specific [volume](/compute/instances/concepts/#volumes) of your Instance. A snapshot is a full-volume copy stored in our secure data centers. They are usually used to recover volume data or to create a copy of a volume.

<Message type="note">

The snapshot features creates backups of specific volumes only. If you wish to create a backupimage which is a complete backup of your Instance including **all** of its volumes, consider using the [backup feature](/compute/instances/how-to/create-a-backup)

## How to create a snapshot

1. Click **Instances** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The Instances page displays.

2. Click the **Snapshots** tab.

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-create-a-snapshot.png" alt="" />

3. Click the **+ Create a snapshot** button. You are directed to the snapshot creation wizard.

4. Complete the following steps in the wizard: 
    - Choose a **name** for the snapshot, or use the default suggested name.
    - Select the **volume** you wish to snapshot. All of your Instances' volumes will be shown on the drop-down list, grouped by Availability Zone.
    - Check the **Estimated Cost**.

5. Click **Create a new snapshot** to finish. You are redirected to the **Snapshots** tab, where your new snapshot now appears in the list.

## How to create an image from a snapshot

### Creating an image from a single snapshot

You can use the [following section](#creating-an-image-from-multiple-snapshots) to create an image from a single snapshot, but these instructions show you an even quicker way:

1. Click **Instances** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The Instances page displays.

2. Click the **Snapshots** tab.

3. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the snapshot you want to create an image from. A drop-down menu displays.

4. Click **Image from snapshot**. A pop-up displays.

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-image-from-snapshot.png" alt="" />

5. Enter:
    - a **name** for the image (or use the default suggested name)
    - the **architecture** for the image (arm, arm64 or x86_64).

  <Message type="important">

  Make sure that the architecture selected corresponds to the system architecture of the snapshot.

  </Message>

6. Click **Create image from snapshot**. 

The image is created, and can be viewed in the [Images tab](https://console.scaleway.com/instance/images).

### Creating an image from multiple snapshots

1. Click **Instances** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The Instances page displays.

2. Click the **Images** tab.

3. Click **+ Create an image**. The image creation wizard displays.

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-image-from-multiple-snapshots.png" alt="" />

4. Complete the following steps:
    - Choose an **Availability Zone** for your image, the geographical region where it will be located.
    - Choose a **name** and **architecture** for the image (arm, arm64 or x86_64).

  <Message type="important">

  An image cannot run on multiple architectures. Make sure that the selected architecture corresponds to the system architecture of all the snapshots.

  </Message>

    - Choose the **source snapshots** you want to create the image from. You can choose one or many snapshotted volumes.

5. Click **Create a new image** to finish.

The image is created, and can be viewed in the [Images tab](https://console.scaleway.com/instance/images).

<Message type="tip">

To create a new Instance from your image, follow the instructions for [creating an Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance). At the **Choose an Image** step of the creation wizard, click the **My Images** tab, and select the desired image.

## How to create a volume from a snapshot

You can create a [volume](/compute/instances/concepts/#volume) from a snapshot as follows:

1. Click **Instances** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The Instances page displays.

2. Click the **Snapshots** tab.

3. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the snapshot you want to create an image from. A drop-down menu displays.

4. Click **Volume from snapshot**. A pop-up displays.

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-volume-from-snapshot.png" alt="" />

5. Enter a name for the volume (or use the default suggested name), and click **Create Volume from Snapshot**

6. Click **Create image from snapshot**. 

The volume is created, and can be viewed in the [Volumes tab](https://console.scaleway.com/instance/volumes). Check out our documentation on [attaching volumes](/storage/block/how-to/attach-a-volume) and [mounting volumes](/storage/block/how-to/mount-and-use-volume) to learn how to use the volume with your Instances.

## How to create an Instance from a snapshot

Follow the instructions for [creating an Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance). At the **Choose an Image** step of the creation wizard, click the **My Snapshots** tab, and select the desired snapshot.

<Lightbox src="scaleway-create-from-snapshot.png" alt="" />

You can see the snapshotted volume in the Instance's volumes at step 4 of the creation wizard.
