You can select the version of your Redis™ database engine upon the creation of your Database Instance. Once your Database Instance is created, you can update the database engine to a newer version at any time. 
 
<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have a [Redis™ Database Instance](/managed-databases/redis/how-to/create-a-database-for-redis) running on a Redis™ engine version older than the latest release
</Message>

1. Click **Redis™** under **Managed Databases** on the side menu. A list of your Database Instances displays.

    <Message type="tip">
      Alternatively you can click the database name or <Icon name="more" /> > **More info**, then click **Upgrade** under **Version** in the Database Instances information page.

3. Select the version to which you want to upgrade. 
4. Click **Upgrade**. 
    <Message type="note">
      It is not possible to downgrade your Redis™ engine version once it has been upgraded. 
    </Message>

    <Message type="important">
      The upgrade process takes a couple minutes to finalize. During this time, if you have a Database Instance in cluster mode, the upgrade will be performed on one node at a time. This means that one node will restart while the others continue to run. Database Instances in standalone mode will be unavailable while they restart.
